# Bevy 2D Procedural Content Generation World

This project demonstrates a minimal working 2D procedural world made using the Bevy game engine and Rust language that can be used as a kickstarter for anyone who likes to build 2D grid-based procedural generation games.

## Tool

- Engine: Bevy 0.19.0
- Language: Rust 1.95.0
- Package Manager: Cargo 1.95.0

## Running

There are 2 ways to visualize the generated world:

1. Window  
2. Terminal ASCII  

### Window

```
cargo run
```

<img src="assets/window_demo.png" alt="Window demo"/>

### Terminal ASCII

```
cargo run -- --ascii
```

<img src="assets/ascii_demo.png" alt="Window demo"/>

## Moving Around

- `w/s/a/d` to move around the generated world
- In Terminal ASCII mode, press `q` to quit
